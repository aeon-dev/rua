# All register control lines on the databus are 2 74138's 3 to 8-line decoder/demultiplexer.
# This means that they are controlled by 8-bits (4 for reading, 4 for writing) This also means
# that the hardware doesn't allow for writing or reading to multiple registers on the bus
# at the same time, which will make this less error prone
# The enable line for this is on eeprom 2, which is why all these values have their 8th bit set.
